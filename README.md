# BadMeshMarker
Simple tool for maya to mark Meshes with Ngons by coloring them in Red in the outliner.

After using sanity checks (for modeling cleanup) on large/complex files, I find it quite redundant to have to check the whole scene again and again just to jump on the next item for cleanup, 

i wrote this tool so i could scan the scene just ones and have a quick overview and quickly select the bad meshes in the outliner. 
For now it's very basic, and detects only Ngons, if i find it usefull i will definetly add other features

**INSTRUCTIONS**
